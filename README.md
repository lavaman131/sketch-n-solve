# Sketch 'n Solve

Sketch 'n Solve is a Python library that implements basic randomized numerical linear algebra (RandNLA) techniques for solving large-scale linear systems of equations. The library is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, with a focus on simplicity and efficiency. The library is built on top of NumPy and SciPy, and provides a simple interface for solving linear systems using randomized algorithms.
